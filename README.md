# LibraryWorkspace

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.6.

## About

This is a repository where I develop and test a few UI/behavior angular components. This is my first project of such
and there by some files or folders may not have the most optimal naming or structure.

## Testing

There are some ways to test these libraries. I choose to create a demo-app application at the path `./projects/demo-app`. I felt it wasn't necessary to push it to gitHub, but feel free to do it if you want.

To generate a lib use at the root : `ng generate application app-name` 

To generate an app for testing use: `ng generate library library-name`

Official documentation about libraries can be found at: [Creating Libraries in Angular](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/creating-libraries)
